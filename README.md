# calculator
A simple calculator app that uses html, javascript, and bootstrap

I am trying to simplify the process of adding new buttons, so I created a button class.
To add new button logic:
1. Write a function that takes 1 or 2 numbers and returns the result.
2. Create a new "Button" object and pass in your function as one of the parameters.
3. Add your button to the html

ToDo: Automate step #3

Possible features to add:
Cut/Copy/Paste

Custom macros
